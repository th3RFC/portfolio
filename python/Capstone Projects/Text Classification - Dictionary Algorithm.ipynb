    "Welcome to this Jupyter notebook that embarks on an innovative journey in text analysis. Our focus here is not just on extracting key terms from text strings, but on elevating this process by assigning these terms to custom classifications that resonate with specific business contexts and use cases. In doing so, we transition from a generic clustering approach to a more targeted text classification methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shifting from Clustering to Custom Classification\n",
    "Traditional text clustering, an unsupervised machine learning method, often groups text in a manner that may not be directly meaningful or applicable in certain business scenarios. To counter this, we pivot to a supervised learning model, utilizing predefined categories that are more aligned with our specific objectives and contextual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Code: A Synergy of Text Processing and Custom Mapping\n",
    "This notebook presents a comprehensive codebase that integrates several Python libraries and techniques:\n",
    "- **Libraries and Preprocessing**: Utilizing libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation, `nltk` for natural language processing, and standard tools for text normalization and preprocessing.\n",
    "- **Advanced Keyword Extraction**: Employing methods to extract not just individual words but also significant pairs (bigrams) and triples (trigrams) of words, adding depth to our analysis.\n",
    "- **Creating a Custom Dictionary**: We define a dictionary with keys representing our bespoke categories (like 'Environment', 'Technology', 'Sports') and values that are specific terms or phrases.\n",
    "- **Classification Algorithm**: Our custom function, `find_key_by_value`, processes text data to classify it under the most relevant category from our dictionary, based on the occurrence and relevance of keywords.\n",
    "- **Practical Application on Data**: We apply this function to real data, both on individual text strings and on a DataFrame, demonstrating its practical utility in assigning relevant topics to text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective and Conclusion\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to provide a framework that transforms general text data into meaningful, context-specific classifications. By the end of this exploration, you will have a versatile tool for text analysis that not only offers insights tailored to specific business needs but also enhances the decision-making process with data that is classified in a more meaningful and contextually relevant manner."

    "### Essential Python Libraries for Dictionary Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Before exploring this Dictionary Algorithm notebook, let's import the necessary Python libraries that will be pivotal in building this algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pandas`**: A foundational library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series, making it ideal for handling and analyzing large datasets, such as collections of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`nltk`**: The Natural Language Toolkit, a comprehensive library in Python for processing and analyzing human language data. It includes libraries for breaking texts down into their constituent parts, tagging them, identifying semantic information, and categorizing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`nltk.corpus.stopwords`**: A module within NLTK specifically for accessing a collection of 'stop words'. Stop words are commonly used words (such as 'the', 'is', 'in') that are typically ignored in text processing and natural language understanding tasks because they carry minimal meaningful content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`string`**: This standard Python library is essential for handling and manipulating string data. It provides capabilities such as basic string formatting, constants, and utility functions, which are particularly useful for tasks like punctuation removal in text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`unicodedata`**: A Python module that provides access to the Unicode Character Database. In text processing, this is particularly useful for normalizing texts, ensuring consistent character representation across different text samples and encoding formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`collections.Counter`**: Part of the Python collections module, `Counter` is a subclass of dictionary that's used for counting hashable objects. It's an ideal tool for keeping track of word frequencies in a text, which is a common requirement in various text analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By importing these libraries at the beginning, we ensure that all the necessary tools are readily available for efficient and effective text analysis and processing. Each library plays a crucial role in handling different aspects of language data and data manipulation, ensuring a comprehensive approach to our text processing tasks."

    "Certainly! With the updated functionality of the code to include rolling triples, the markdown description should be revised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enhanced Text Analysis for Keyword Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python code defines a function `find_key_by_value` which takes a string and a dictionary as inputs. Here's a detailed breakdown of what the function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lowercase Conversion**: Converts the input string to lowercase to ensure consistent treatment of words, e.g., 'Dog' and 'dog' are considered identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tokenization and Punctuation Removal**: Utilizes NLTK's `word_tokenize` to split the string into words (tokens). Non-alphanumeric tokens, essentially punctuation, are filtered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminates common stop words like 'and', 'the', 'is', etc., from the list of words. These words are usually irrelevant in text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate Rolling Pairs and Triples**:\n",
    "   - **Pairs (Bigrams)**: Creates pairs of consecutive words. For instance, [\"hello\", \"world\", \"example\"] becomes [\"hello world\", \"world example\"].\n",
    "   - **Triples (Trigrams)**: Generates triples of consecutive words. For example, [\"hello\", \"world\", \"example\", \"text\"] results in [\"hello world example\", \"world example text\"].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Search in Dictionary**: Each word, word pair, and word triple is checked against the dictionary values. Matching dictionary keys are collected in `matching_keys`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Count and Find Most Common Key**: Uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to tally the occurrence of each key in `matching_keys`. The most frequently appearing key is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Return Result**: Returns the most common key if matches exist, or `None` if no matches are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function enhances text processing by removing noise (like punctuation and stop words) and identifying significant single words, pairs, and triples. It then matches these elements with the values in a dictionary, returning the key of the most frequently found value. This is particularly useful for tasks like keyword extraction, where identifying the most relevant topic or category in a text is essential."
